During my university studies, I developed multiple projects using the Python programming language, with a focus on clean architecture and object-oriented programming (OOP). My projects were structured using the Service–Repository–Domain architecture, promoting modularity, reusability, and a clear separation of concerns. I implemented functionalities using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, and worked extensively with text files for data persistence.

A strong emphasis was placed on writing clean, testable code, and I regularly applied testing strategies to ensure functionality and reliability. These projects helped reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts as well as architectural design patterns.

In addition to my university work, I completed a specialized course in Python with automated testing at ITFactory. During this course, I gained hands-on experience with Selenium for browser automation and learned how to apply Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles using tools like Gherkin and Behave. This training enhanced my practical skills in writing automated tests, working with test scenarios, and integrating testing into the development workflow.

Combined, these academic and extracurricular experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in both software development and automated testing using Python.
