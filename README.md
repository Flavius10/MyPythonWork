During my university studies, I developed multiple projects using the Python programming language, with a focus on clean architecture and object-oriented programming (OOP). The projects followed a structured architecture based on the Service–Repository–Domain pattern, which allowed for a clear separation of concerns and maintainable code organization.

Throughout these projects, I implemented core programming concepts such as functions, classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. I worked extensively with text files for data storage and retrieval, building applications that processed and managed information through custom file-handling logic. This helped me strengthen both my algorithmic thinking and my ability to work with persistent data in the absence of databases.

An important aspect of my work was writing modular and testable code, with a strong emphasis on correctness and robustness. I regularly created and executed test cases to validate functionality, detect bugs, and ensure code reliability.

Overall, this experience gave me a solid foundation in software design principles, especially in object-oriented development, and prepared me for larger-scale application development using best practices in architecture and testing.
